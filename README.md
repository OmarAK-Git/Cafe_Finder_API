# Cafe_Finder_API

A self-hosted webpage that is connected to a local database. The purpose of this project is to create a restful API. 
Requests are sent to the webserver, read by the code, and returned as JSON data.

## Functionality
The database contains a list of coffee shops in the UK along with many attributes that might interest coffee shop enjoyers. Some of these attributes include Wifi signal strength, seats, toilets, and coffee price. Developers who are interested in leveraging this information can make call functions to this database to access that information and use it in their projects. 

## Documentation 
Postman was used to test the API to avoid the creation of WTForms.
List of requests, description, and methods are published below:
